## HOW TO USE THESE WITH GEMINI:

1. Copy the prompt inside the ``` code block ```
2. Paste into Gemini image generation
3. If text rendering is poor, generate image WITHOUT text, then add text in Canva
4. For the 3D illustration style (Ad #2), Gemini handles these well
5. For photo-realistic ones, may need to use stock photos + text overlay

---

## RECOMMENDED TESTING ORDER:

1. **AD 2** (3D style) — Pattern interrupt, proven format
2. **AD 1** (Graduation angle) — Direct match to advertorial
3. **AD 5** (Testimonial quote) — Social proof without fake UI
4. **AD 4** ($500 mistake) — Problem agitation

These align with the "graduation photo shock" story in your advertorial and maintain congruence through the funnel.
