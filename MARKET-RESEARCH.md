## 🔑 KEY COPY INSIGHTS

### The "Aha" Moment
Many women describe a sudden realization - they "never noticed" their neck until one day they did. The advertorial should tap into this universal experience.

### The Desperation Phase
They've tried things. They've researched. They're skeptical but still hoping. The copy needs to acknowledge this journey.

### The Permission to Hope
They want to believe something works. Give them permission to try one more thing, but with credibility (clinical studies, real testimonials, guarantee).

### The Affordable Alternative
Position as the smart choice between "doing nothing" and "$10,000 surgery." The middle ground that actually works.

### The "I Wish I Started Sooner"
Regret is a powerful emotion. Frame the product as prevention + treatment. Don't wait until it's too late.
